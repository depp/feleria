# Legend of Feleria

This is a game for Ludum Dare #31, for the theme "Entire Game on One Screen".

Movement: WASD or arrow keys.

Interaction: Space, X, or '.'.

Okay, there's a lot missing from this game.  There's no serious gameplay.  Just a short story, with some music and pictures.  Everything was made under the solo rules, except with a 72 hour time limit.  There are some minor cool pieces of tech in here, like a terrain generator and a 16-bit virtual machine for scripting.
