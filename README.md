# Legend of Feleria

This is a game for Ludum Dare #31, for the theme "Entire Game on One Screen".

Okay, there's a lot missing from this game.  There's no serious gameplay.  Just a short story, with some music and pictures.

There are some minor cool pieces of tech in here, like a terrain generator and a 16-bit virtual machine for scripting.
